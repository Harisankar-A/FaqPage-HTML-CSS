# FAQ Page

This repository contains an HTML document for a simple FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page. The page lists common questions with icons next to them, designed to be expanded later for detailed answers.

## Features

- **Frequently Asked Questions**: The page displays a list of common questions in a clean, simple format.
- **Icons**: Each question has a plus icon next to it, which could be expanded for showing the answer in future iterations.
- **Basic Styling**: The page uses custom CSS to format the background, container, and question elements.
- **Responsive Layout**: The layout is flexible and adjusts based on screen size.

## How It Works

### HTML Structure:
- **Heading**: The page includes a main heading titled "Frequently Asked Question" at the top.
- **Question List**: A list of questions is displayed in a structured manner with each question styled in a bold font and separated by a bottom border.
- **Icons**: A FontAwesome plus icon (`fa-circle-plus`) is placed next to each question, indicating that an answer can be revealed (the functionality for this can be added later).

### CSS Styling:
- **Background Color**: The background color of the page is set to grey, with the FAQ container having a beige color.
- **Container Layout**: The FAQ container is centered on the page, with a width of 80% and a height of 400px, surrounded by padding and a rounded border.
- **Font and Layout**: The questions are aligned with a flexbox layout, ensuring they are spaced evenly, and styled with a Courier New font for a clean and modern look.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure for displaying the list of frequently asked questions.
- **CSS**: Custom styling for the FAQ container, question items, and page layout.
- **FontAwesome**: For the plus icons next to each question.
